# Park-Advisor

A full stack web application for travelers who want to search, review, and track their vists to different national parks & monuments.

## Why I Built This

My parents helped inspire this project. They recently have made it a goal to visit each state and compete in a half marathon there. During each trip they visit a different national park/monument near the race. I was inspired by their trips to create something that could track people's visits to each state in a fun and interactive visual. I had seen different tools where people track their visits to countries on various scratch-off-maps and wanted to make something similar where people could not only mark that they've visited but also record their thoughts on a park visit.
